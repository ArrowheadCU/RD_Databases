Challenges with RDBMS
	- 'Impedence Mismatch'
	- Cost effective scalablity (Need more power)
	- Schema dependencies
	- Execution runtime limiting analysis capabilities


NoSQL Definition (Character
	-non-relational
	-cluster friendly
	-open-source
	-schema-less (sort of)
		-There needs to be implicit schema to understand how to pull data
		 out of object (i.e. understand naming conventions of keys)

Types
	Aggregate Oriented - Allow one to store complex data structures
		Types:
			-Document Store (Document is aggregate)
			-Key Value (Value is the aggregate)
			-Column-Family
		Pro/Con
			-Advantage: Read and write
			-Disadvantage: Aggregate data beyond index (slice and dice data)
	
	Graph Oriented
		Pro/Con
			-Advantages: Capablitity complex relationships

Consistency
	RDBMS = ACID
	NoSQL = BASE except Graph = ACID
		-Update transaction records with
		-Have Option between consistence or availability (Business choice)
	CAP Theorem - Can choose up to 2
		Partition
		Consistency
		Availability

Biggest Advantage of NoSQL (Solutions)
	-easier deveoplment
	-large scale data
